				Voting Application in Kubernetes
Project Summary
This project demonstrates about makingvoting application in Kubernetes.
First we are going to launch the EC2 instance in linux through AWS cloud
We have configured security group and storage as our needs. Now we are going to install the kubernetes service and create the cluster. Create the pods and database, services and finally we will be running the Voting application.

Install and configuration in Kubernetes
In our linux machine we are going to download the Kubernetes configuration and install on our it.

The commands are given below:
	curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64 
	chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
	sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops
	curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
	chmod +x ./kubectl
	sudomv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
	aws s3 mb s3://kube.in.k8s --region us-west-2

Create and configuration in cluster
	Now we are going to create and configureour cluster. 
Once our cluster is created, check the our kubernetesservice  pods and nodes. The commands are given below:
	vi ~/.bashrc
	source ~/.bashrc
	ssh-keygen
	kops create cluster --state=${KOPS_STATE_STORE} --node-count=2 --master-size=t2.micro --node-size=t2.micro --zones=ap-south-1a,ap-south-1b --name=${KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME} --dns private --master-count 1
	kops update cluster --yes
	kops validate cluster
	ssh admin@api.anadh.in
	kubectl get nodes
	kubectl get service

Install Git and Download Configuration Files
	We are installing the git service in our linux machine and used command clone command for to download the Configuration yaml file
  clone the kubernetes example voting app from github.
The commands are given below:
	yum install git
	git clone https://github.com/mmumshad/kubernetes-example-voting-app.git
	
Create the Voting application
	We are going to create the voting application for kubernetes commands.
 Change the directory for kubernetes example voting application directory. And 
Run the voting application from the yaml file. 
Verify the pods and service to use the kubernetes commands to check the external IP address to the web browser it will show the our voting web page.
The commands are given below:
	cd kubernetes-example-voting-app
	kubectl create -f voting-app-pod.yml
	kubectl create -f voting-app-service.yml
	kubectl get pods,svc

Create the database and redis application
	We are going to create the database and redis for voting application for kubernetes commands.
Run the database from the yaml file. And the run redis service application yaml file.
Verify the pods and service to use kubernetes commands for service running status. 
 The commands are given below:
	kubectl create -f redis-pod.yml
	kubectl create -f redis-service.yml
	kubectl create -f postgres-pod.yml
	kubectl create -f postgres-service.yml
	kubectl get pods,svc

Create the worker and result application
	We are going to create the worker and result for voting application for kubernetes commands.
Run the worker and result from the yaml file. And the run worker and result service application yaml file.
Verify the pods and service to use kubernetes commands for service running status. 
 The commands are given below:
	kubectl create -f worker-app-pod.yml
	kubectl create -f result-app-pod.yml
	kubectl create -f result-app-service.yml
	kubectl get pods,svc

To Test Voting Application
	Finally we are going to run the voting application in our local web page
And put the voting then check the result web page. It will show the result for percentage of vote.
